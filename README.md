# LungMoE-MEFM: Gated Multi-Expert Collaborative Learning for Interpretable Pulmonary Nodule Risk Assessment



Abstract: Accurate early risk assessment of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient prognosis. To address the limitations of current computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that are confined to binary benign-malignant classification of pulmonary nodules and the insufficient interpretability of deep learning methods, this study proposes the LungMoE-MEFM mixture-of-experts model. Utilizing 9,690 annotated samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset with malignancy ratings and eight radiological signs, we innovatively designed a multi-task collaborative architecture to achieve fine-grained pulmonary nodule classification while enhancing decision interpretability. The study establishes a hierarchical architecture with parallel shared expert networks and task-specific experts, innovatively designing the Multi-Expert Feature Fusion Module (MEFM) that employs dual wavelet convolution transforms combined with channel-spatial attention mechanisms to effectively integrate features from various expert networks, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the gating network dynamically allocates task weights to quantitatively reveal inter-sign correlations. In five-level malignancy classification tests on 979 pulmonary nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset, LungMoE-MEFM achieved a weighted accuracy of 76.61\%, surpassing baseline models (ResNet, DenseNet, etc.) by over 20 percentage points. Ablation studies demonstrated that the MEFM module contributed a 3.6\% performance gain, while increasing shared experts yielded a 4.1\% accuracy improvement. Grad-CAM heatmaps revealed high spatial consistency between model-attended regions and radiologist-annotated malignant signs. This study provides a high-accuracy, interpretable intelligent assistant for early lung cancer diagnosis, advancing clinical applications of multi-task learning in medical image analysis.
